## This is where all the files for my E-paper based weather station will go!

This project consists of three parts:
- A "Sender", which is a battery powered probe that sits outside and collects temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data every 5 minutes
- A "Rain Probe", which sits inside, collects rainfall data every half hour, 
- A "Reciever", which sits inside, has a screen to show the data on, and processes and shows all the data.

This Repository ( and project for that matter ) is still a WIP, and will get updated over time.
